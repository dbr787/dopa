# Pipelines should be defined in terraform, and manual pipeline creation restricted.
# Pipeline definitions will include mandatory steps at the beginning and/or end of a pipeline.
# The `buildkite-agent pipeline upload` step will allow user-defined pipelines to be created and stored
#   in the project repository .buildkite/ directory - providing a 'shift-left' usage model.

# For OPA, docker image could be included in image or pulled in agent bootstrap.
# Evaluation scripts and policies could be cloned from a central repository

# What about a 'policy' agent queue/stack, in which the image/bootstrap includes a running OPA server.
# We can modify the agent checkout hook on the 'policy' stack to 

# TODO
# Block step to allow continue on policy eval failure, only on non-production branches
# Test looping error code 1, 2, and 3, and having conditional block step based on error code?
# Annotate results

## Repository Hook Order
# 01. post-checkout
# 02. pre-command
# 03. command
# 04. post-command
# 05. pre-artifact
# 06. post-artifact
