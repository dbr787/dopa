# Pipelines should be defined in terraform, and manual pipeline creation restricted.
# Pipeline definitions will include mandatory steps at the beginning and/or end of a pipeline.
# The `buildkite-agent pipeline upload` step will allow user-defined pipelines to be created and stored
#   in the project repository .buildkite/ directory - providing a 'shift-left' usage model.

# For OPA, docker image could be included in image or pulled in agent bootstrap.
# Evaluation scripts and policies could be cloned from a central repository

# OR
# What about a 'policy' agent queue/stack, in which the image/bootstrap includes a running OPA server.
# First step in UI yaml is to clone and run policies, then a wait step

# OR
# First UI-defined pipeline step runs a plugin to override the command hook/checkout of the repo.
#   This command could instead clone the policy repo? 

# OR
# Can we run pipeline upload in an agent hook, not really cos it runs on every job/step? right?

# TODO
# Block step to allow continue on policy eval failure, only on non-production branches
# Test looping error code 1, 2, and 3, and having conditional block step based on error code?
# Annotate results

# QUESTIONS
# Where should I clone the policy repo?

## Repository Hook Order
# 01. post-checkout
# 02. pre-command
# 03. command
# 04. post-command
# 05. pre-artifact
# 06. post-artifact
# 07. pre-exit
